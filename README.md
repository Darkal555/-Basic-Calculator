This code represents a simple calculator web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief explanation
   HTML Structure: The HTML file contains a calculator form with an input display to show the calculations and various buttons for numbers, operators, and functions like clear (C), clear entry (CE), and square (sqr).

CSS Styling: The calculator is styled using CSS, with a vibrant background color, rounded edges, and shadows for a visually appealing look. The display and buttons have distinct styles, including hover effects.

JavaScript Logic: The JavaScript file defines functions for handling user interactions. The toScreen function appends the clicked button value to the display. The answer function evaluates and displays the result, the sqr function squares the current value, and backSpace removes the last digit.

Dynamic Display: The calculator display dynamically updates as users interact with the buttons, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience.

Evaluation: The eval function is used to perform mathematical evaluations based on the user's input, allowing for a wide range of calculations.

Button Interactivity: Buttons change their appearance when clicked (active state), enhancing the visual feedback for user interactions.

Clear Functionality: The 'C' button clears the entire input, and 'CE' clears the last entry, providing convenient ways to modify calculations.

Error Handling: The calculator handles basic errors and edge cases, providing a reasonably robust user experience.

Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and appearance for different screen sizes.

Font Styling: The Quicksand font is used for a modern and clean look, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the calculator.
